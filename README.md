# NumAnalysis

We are developing a ML learning algorithm to learn and predict correlation between several characteristics of human activity and health statistics. Additionally, we implement Jacobian and Gauss-Seidel Iterative methods to improve computation time and approximation accuracy. 

File Purposes:
- LinearModel.py compares the speed and quality of a few different methods for learning/solving dataset
- Forest.py implements the random forest ML model to learn and predict data
- student_health_data.csv is our dataset, 1000 entries
- To run the above files, use python LinearModel/Forest.py 
- med_app.py launches a web application that can assess and give feedback on health characteristics
- Use streamlit run med_app.py
